# Autism Sensory Model

This repository presents a multidimensional model to understand autism not primarily as a behavioral syndrome, but as an emergent adaptation to sensory processing differences.  
It proposes a shift from symptom-based classification to systemic, cause-oriented interpretation.

## Why this matters

Autism is typically diagnosed based on observable symptoms.  
But what if many of these are logical responses to a fundamentally different sensory reality?

This model invites researchers, practitioners, and neurodivergent individuals to rethink autism as a dynamic, emergent system ‚Äì grounded in perception, modulation, environment, and self-regulation.
