### Autism Reconsidered: How Sensory Processing Shapes Behavioral Patterns
*A popular science summary*

### The Puzzle of the Autism Spectrum
Autism is often described as a "spectrum" – a term that suggests diversity but explains little. Why do some people show tendencies toward social withdrawal, others language peculiarities, and yet others intense special interests? Current diagnostics collect these symptoms like puzzle pieces without a picture guide. But what if all these behaviors are **consequences of a common cause**?

### The Underestimated Lead Role: Our Senses
The revolutionary thesis:
> **Many "autistic" behavioral patterns are not disorders in themselves, but clever adaptation strategies to a differently functioning sensory perception.**

Imagine:
- A fluorescent light feels like a welding torch
- A conversation in a café sounds like a jackhammer concert
- A soft T-shirt scratches like sandpaper

For many autistic individuals, this is everyday reality. Their nervous system processes stimuli differently – some are amplified, others filtered, some sensory channels are hypersensitive, others hyposensitive.

### From Stimulus to Response: How Behavioral Patterns Emerge
From these sensory particularities arise logical survival strategies:

| **Behavior**           | **Possible Cause**                                 | **Example**                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Social withdrawal      | Protection from sensory overload in groups         | Child leaves noisy school celebration   |
| Language avoidance     | Energy conservation during auditory overload       | Nonverbal communication via tablet      |
| Repetitive movements   | Self-calming through controlled stimuli (stimming) | Hand flapping, humming, rhythmic patterns|
| Special interests      | Focus on predictable, safe stimulus environments   | Obsessive knowledge of train schedules  |

### The Diagnostic Error: Symptoms ≠ Cause
Currently, diagnostic logic states:
*"If someone shows social withdrawal + repetitive movements = autism"*

But this approach has three problems:
1. **Similar symptoms, different causes**: Social withdrawal can arise from sensory overload OR social anxieties
2. **Individual profiles**: No two people have the same sensory stimulus pattern
3. **Environmental influence**: The same person shows hardly any "symptoms" in a low-stimulus environment

"Autism" is thus not a fixed "entity," but an **emergency plan of the brain** for dealing with a stimulus-intensive world.

### What follows from this? New paths for therapy & research

**Research should:**
- Map sensory profiles instead of extending symptom lists
- Examine neurochemical patterns (e.g., stress hormone cortisol)
- Define subtypes by causes, not by surface behavior

**Therapy should:**
- Not "train away" behaviors (eye contact exercises, etc.)
- But instead:
  - 🛋️ **Create low-stimulus environments** (dimmed lighting, noise-cancelling headphones)
  - 🔄 **Promote self-regulation** (recognize stimming as a legitimate strategy)
  - 🧩 **Respect individual stimulus profiles** (e.g., take fabric sensitivities seriously)

A teenager describes it this way:
> "When I understood my sensory triggers, my behavior suddenly made sense to others. I no longer need to 'explain' myself – we now design my space together."

---

### The New Model: Five Dimensions Instead of One Label
Autism cannot be reduced to a single cause. What's crucial is the interplay of:

1. **Sensory Profile** (Where/how strongly does stimulus processing deviate?)
2. **Neurochemistry** (How do hormones/neurotransmitters modulate the reaction?)
3. **Environment** (What stimuli does the surroundings provide?)
4. **Cognitive Tools** (How is the experience reflected upon?)
5. **Coping Strategies** (Which techniques have proven effective?)

---

### The Big Question for Our Society
> **"How many ways of feeling and perceiving have room in our world?"**

- The boundary between "autistic" and "neurotypical" is fluid
- Many people have sensory particularities – only the distress makes them "sick"
- Similar mechanisms could be at work in ADHD, high sensitivity, or anxiety disorders

Instead of pushing people into categories, we should ask:
*"What conditions do you need to feel safe and capable?"*

---

### Conclusion: From Deficit to Difference Model
Autism is not a disorder that we need to "repair." It is a **different way of perceiving the world**, which:
- Produces logical adaptation strategies
- Requires societal flexibility
- Expands our understanding of human diversity

As Temple Grandin, autistic professor, says:
> *"The world needs different kinds of thinkers: the artists, the pattern recognition, the detail-oriented."*

By taking sensory differences seriously, we transform therapy from **adaptation to norms** to **cooperation between neurotypes**.
