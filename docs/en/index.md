# A multidimensional model to explain autistic behavioral patterns based on sensory processing

## Abstract

This paper questions the common diagnosis of autism as a symptom-based disorder and proposes a systemic-sensory model instead. It argues that many autistic behaviors - such as social withdrawal, language avoidance, or repetitive patterns - should be understood as secondary strategies in dealing with sensory processing. The diagnostic threshold does not arise from the presence of certain traits, but from the collision of individual stimulus profiles with societal demands. This results in a differentiated, multidimensional approach to explaining, classifying, and supporting neurodivergent individuals.
