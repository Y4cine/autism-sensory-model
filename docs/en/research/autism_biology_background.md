## ðŸ§  Biological Foundations: Genetics and Neural Connectivity

Autism is not an invention of the environment or merely a behavioral anomaly â€“ it has a **deep biological foundation**, as numerous studies over the past two decades have shown.

### 1. Genetic Evidence

According to Thapar & Rutter (2021), the **heritability** of autism spectrum disorders is around **80â€“90%** â€“ meaning genetic factors explain the majority of variability between individuals with and without autism. It is not a single "autism gene" that plays a role, but rather a multitude of genetic variants that **accumulate** or occur in **rare combinations**:

> *"Autism is a complex genetic trait, with contributions from both rare variants of large effect and common variants of small effect."*  
> â€” Thapar & Rutter, 2021 ([PMID 32940822](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32940822/))

These genetic predispositions primarily affect **neural development, synaptic plasticity, and sensory integration** â€“ which directly leads to our focus.

### 2. Brain Connectivity and Sensory Instability

Neuroimaging studies show that autistic brains exhibit **atypical connectivity**. Particularly striking is a pattern of:

- **local overconnectivity** (e.g., in sensory areas),
- and simultaneous **global underconnectivity** (e.g., between prefrontal, limbic, and sensory regions).

This "underintegrated architecture" has been documented by MÃ¼ller et al. (2011) and Maximo et al. (2014):

> *"Atypical functional connectivity has been consistently reported in autism, especially reduced long-range and increased local connectivity."*  
> â€” Maximo et al., 2014 ([PMID 24496901](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24496901/))

> *"Underconnectivity in autism appears to reflect impaired coordination across distant regions, potentially explaining difficulties with multisensory integration and social cognition."*  
> â€” MÃ¼ller et al., 2011 ([PMID 21378114](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21378114/))

### 3. Synthesis: Sensory Processing as a Neurobiological Focal Point

Thus, genetic predisposition leads to an atypical neural architecture â€“ which in turn results in altered **sensory processing**. In this light, sensory instability does not appear as a secondary symptom but as a **central consequence** of altered neurobiological organization.

Our model focuses precisely on this:  
**Not the genes, not the behavior â€“ but the unstable sensory interface** is considered the starting point upon which autistic strategies, compulsive behaviors, and social withdrawals are built.
