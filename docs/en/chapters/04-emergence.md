## 4. **Emergent reaction patterns: When similar causes have different effects**

Even if sensory sensitivity may be the common denominator – the reaction to it is by no means uniform. Even with very similar stimulus profiles, people develop completely different coping strategies: one withdraws, another becomes aggressive. One ritualizes their daily routine, another develops fixations on controllable content. Why?

The answer lies in **emergence**: Behavior is not directly derivable from an input (e.g., high stimulus level), but arises through **interaction with other system factors**:

* **Neurochemical modulators:** e.g., stress reactions (cortisol), drive systems (dopamine), social openness (oxytocin)
* **Physical variables:** energy balance, immune system, hormonal regulation
* **Socialization and environment:** early experiences, parental behavior, societal expectations
* **Cognitive resources:** language, abstraction ability, introspective capacity

All these factors act as filters, amplifiers, or dampeners – shaping different paths from the same starting point. Nevertheless, it's striking: "Autistic" reaction patterns often strongly resemble each other. And that is actually remarkable.

**Why is this?** Two hypotheses:

1. **There are evolutionarily robust standard strategies** for dealing with sensory overload – such as withdrawal, stimulus control, repetition. These strategies establish themselves independently because they are functional.

2. **The social environment forces selection:** Only certain behaviors are tolerated or viable. For example, someone who regulates their sensory sensitivity through open stimulus avoidance becomes socially excluded – while "quiet withdrawal" remains as silent suffering and thus less noticeable.

This creates a picture of autism that systematically deceives us: The observed similarity is not the result of identical personalities, but **the result of similar adaptation logic in a limited space of possible solutions.**
