## 1. **Introduction: Why we need to rethink autism**

Autism is a term that has remained simultaneously familiar and surprisingly vague. It suggests clarity, specificity, a known clinical picture – and yet in reality, it is a catchment basin for diverse phenomena connected more by external observation than by internal logic. Those who delve deeper into the subject quickly encounter a disconcerting juxtaposition: On one hand, clear diagnoses, support measures, public discourse. On the other hand, a bewildering variety of manifestations, contradictions, and individual differences that are difficult to reconcile.

In current medical and psychological practice, autism is defined primarily through symptoms: difficulties in social interactions, language peculiarities, repetitive behaviors, special interests, sensory sensitivities. But what if many of these symptoms aren't primary – but rather **reactions to a much more fundamental cause**?

This paper proposes a radical shift in perspective: Away from superficial description, toward a systemically understood model that places **sensory processing as the central cause** at its core. Sensory sensitivity – in all its variants – is not a minor aspect, but possibly the key to understanding the phenomenon. Behavior described as "autistic" could then reveal itself as an **emergent strategy for dealing with sensory reality**.

At the same time, we would need to accept that "autism" is not a uniform syndrome, but rather an **observational umbrella for different forms of adaptation** to internal and external conditions. Such a perspective would not only deepen scientific understanding but also lead to more individualized, respectful, and effective forms of support.
