## 3. **Sensory processing as the central key: The underestimated primary dimension**

What if many of the behaviors we label as "autistic" are not disorders *in themselves*, but rather **logical adaptive responses to a divergent sensory inner world**?

The central thesis of this paper is:

> **Sensory sensitivity – its expression, type, and processing dynamics – is not a peripheral phenomenon of autism, but its primary driving force.**

People with autism diagnoses often report experiencing a world that is too loud, too bright, too complex, or simply too intense. These are not "quirks," but existentially tangible realities: fluorescent lights that burn like a welding torch, fabrics that feel like sandpaper, sounds barely perceptible to others that put the nervous system on high alert.

This sensory world is not just different – it is **formative**. From it emerge many of the observable characteristics:

* **Social withdrawal** can be a strategy to shield oneself from overwhelming sensory environments.
* **Language avoidance** can be a reaction to the energy demands of complex communication situations that overwhelm both cognitively and auditorily simultaneously.
* **Repetitive behavior** ("stimming") can serve as a stabilization technique – a form of self-regulation that creates familiar, pleasant stimuli and thereby establishes inner security.

Additionally, the type of sensory sensitivity varies greatly – in several respects:

* **Affected sensory channel:** auditory, visual, tactile, proprioceptive, etc.
* **Reaction direction:** hypersensitivity (hyper-reaction) vs. hyposensitivity (hypo-reaction)
* **Coping strategy:** stimulus avoidance, stimulus seeking, stimulus processing through rituals or focus narrowing

These differences are not coincidental, but reflect different neural sensitivities – possibly mediated genetically or hormonally. What's striking is that despite highly individual sensory profiles, **similar behavioral patterns repeatedly emerge**, as if there were certain "standard responses" to sensory overload.

This suggests the idea: **Sensory sensitivity systematically generates similar reaction patterns** – not because people are the same, but because the body-mind-world system responds similarly to overload. And these reaction patterns are what we currently label as "autism."
