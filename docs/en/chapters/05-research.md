## 5. **Consequences for research and therapy: From training to understanding**

If we no longer view autism as a clearly defined disorder with fixed symptoms, but as an emergent reaction to sensory and systemic conditions, then the focus of research and therapy also shifts.

### ðŸ§ª In research:

Currently, symptom-oriented diagnostics dominates, supplemented by genetic studies that often remain inconclusive. What's missing is a targeted, systemic approach that asks questions such as:

* How do sensory processing, hormonal modulation, and environmental interaction work together?
* Are there stable neurochemical patterns (e.g., in the stress axis or oxytocin/dopamine system) that condition certain stimulus-response dynamics?
* How can we differentiate autistic subtypes not by surface appearance, but by cause?

Such questions require **interdisciplinary research**: neuroscience, endocrinology, psychology, education, and even cybernetics would need to cooperate. What's missing today is an **overarching functional model** that doesn't classify symptoms, but **maps the interaction of the levels involved**.

### ðŸ›  In practice:

Current practice often aims at behavioral training. Autistic children learn eye contact, interrupting routines, or "appropriate" social behavior. But if these behaviors are **symptoms of a profound stimulus imbalance**, then training merely addresses the surface â€“ without changing the inner reality. In the worst case, the child only learns to mask better â€“ at the expense of energy, well-being, and identity.

A **cause-oriented support** would need to take a different approach:

* Creating environments with fewer stimuli or adaptable ones
* Recognizing and respecting individual stimulus profiles
* Promoting sensory self-awareness and regulation
* Embedding in stable, understandable routines (not as compulsion, but as security)
* Strengthening self-determination and individual coping strategies

This type of help is **not corrective**, but **understanding**. It aims not at normalization, but at **cooperation with a different mode of perception**. The focus shifts: from deficit to fit.
