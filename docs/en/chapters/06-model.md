## 6. **Sketch of a New Model: Multidimensional Instead of Monolithic**

From the preceding considerations, a simple yet far-reaching model emerges:

> Autistic behavior is not the result of a single disorder, but the **outcome of a system** in which multiple dimensions interact.

These dimensions vary individually and interact with each other â€“ yet can still produce typical patterns that we currently group under the label "autism."

### ðŸ”„ The five central dimensions:

| **Dimension**                | **Function**                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Sensory Profile**       | Which stimuli are amplified or diminished?           |
| **2. Neurochemistry/Hormones** | How is sensory information modulated internally?     |
| **3. Environment & Socialization** | Which experiences and contexts shape behavior?   |
| **4. Cognitive Resources**   | How is sensory processing intellectually managed?    |
| **5. Coping Strategies**     | Which patterns have proven effective?                |

Such a framework not only allows for **more differentiated diagnostics** but also **tailored support** that is aligned with actual needs.

At the same time, this model breaks with the illusion that autism is a **fixed entity** â€“ and opens our perspective to what is actually happening: a highly complex form of adaptation to a world that is not designed for a particular way of perception.
